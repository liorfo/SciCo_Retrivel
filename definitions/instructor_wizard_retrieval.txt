by the human voice. These signals are typically captured using microphones and then processed through a series
of steps before being converted into text or commands.

Processing term: Feature Pyramid Network from normal terms


 Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is a deep learning model architecture used for image classification, object
detection, and semantic segmentation. It consists of a series of convolutional layers that take in input
images at different scales and produces feature maps at each level. These feature maps are then combined using
concatenations and upscaling operations to produce final predictions. FPN has become a popular choice for many
state-of-the-art models because it can learn half of the preceding feature maps and has fewer parameters
compared to traditional architectures that use separate convolutional layers for each scale.

Processing term: policy gradient methods from hard 20 terms


 Policy gradient methods are a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that uses the gradient descent method

actions, rewards). By iteratively updating the policy parameters using these estimates, policy gradient
methods can learn an optimal policy that maximizes the expected return.
