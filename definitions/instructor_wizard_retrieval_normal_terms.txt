Processing term: unsupervised automatic facial point detection from normal terms

Unsupervised automatic facial point detection refers to the process of identifying and locating specific
points on a person's face in an image without any prior knowledge or training data about those points. It
involves using computer vision algorithms to identify and track certain landmarks on a person's face, such as
the eyes, nose, and mouth, in order to analyze their facial expressions and emotional states.

Processing term: ASR from normal terms

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a technology that enables machines to recognize and understand human
speech. It involves converting spoken words into text or commands, which can then be used to control devices
or access information. With this context, ASR refers to the process of converting spoken language into
machine-readable text or commands using algorithms and computer programs.

Processing term: Feature Pyramid Network from normal terms

A Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is a deep learning model that combines multiple levels of feature maps
generated by different scales of filters to improve the accuracy of object detection. It was introduced in
2017 by researchers at Google and has since become a popular component of state-of-the-art object detection
models. FPN works by taking in input images at multiple scales and generating feature maps at each scale.
These feature maps are then combined using a series of concatenations and fully connected layers to produce a
final output prediction. By combining features from different scales, FPN can better capture the complexity of
objects and their relationships within the image.

Processing term: spatial attention mechanisms from normal terms

Spatial attention mechanisms are a type of neural network component that allows the model to selectively
attend to certain regions of an input image while ignoring others. They are often used in computer vision
applications like object recognition and segmentation. Essentially, spatial attention mechanisms allow the
model to focus its attention on relevant parts of the image and ignore irrelevant parts, leading to improved
performance on certain tasks.

Processing term: JPEG method from normal terms

The JPEG method refers to the Joint Photographic Experts Group method used for compressing digital images. It
involves converting the image into a discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficient matrix, which is then
quantized and entropy coded before being transmitted or stored. The receiver side uses the side information
such as the DCT coefficients and the quantization tables to decode and reconstruct the image.

Processing term: video data generation from normal terms

Video data generation refers to the process of creating new digital video content from scratch or converting
existing content into a digital format. This may involve capturing footage using cameras or other devices,
editing and assembling raw footage, adding special effects and graphics, and compressing the resulting video
for storage or transmission. As the amount of video data being created continues to grow rapidly, there is a
growing need for automated tools and techniques to analyze and manipulate this data, including video
summarization, indexing and searching, and content-based retrieval.
