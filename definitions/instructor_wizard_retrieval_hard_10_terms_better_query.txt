Processing term: end-to-end deep neural network from hard 10 terms


An "end-to-end" deep neural network refers to a type of neural network architecture where all the layers from
the input layer to the output layer are connected together in a single chain without any intermediate layers.
This means that there are no separate pre-processing or feature extraction layers before the
classification/regression layers. The term "deep" refers to the number of hidden layers in the network, which
can range from one to hundreds or more. End-to-end deep neural networks are commonly used for tasks such as
image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and autonomous driving.

Processing term: Conv ( ) filter from hard 10 terms


 A conv ( ) filter refers to a convolutional filter used in computer vision and machine learning. It is a
mathematical operator that performs a specific operation on two-dimensional arrays, known as images. Conv
filters are commonly used in deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They
are designed to extract features from images by applying a set of weights to the input pixels. The output of a
conv filter is a new image that highlights certain features within the original image.

Processing term: Time Series Analysis from hard 10 terms


Time Series Analysis (TSA) is a statistical technique used to analyze data that is collected over time. It
involves analyzing patterns and trends in the data over multiple time periods to identify any changes or
anomalies that may occur. TSA is often used in fields such as finance, economics, and meteorology to make
predictions about future events based on past data.

Processing term: LSTM from hard 10 terms


 LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is designed to
handle long-term dependencies in sequential data. It is particularly useful for tasks like language modeling,
speech recognition, and sentiment analysis. The LSTM cell consists of a memory gate and an update gate, which
allow it to remember important features of the input sequence while also updating its internal state based on
new information.

Processing term: MLP from hard 10 terms


 MLP stands for Multi-Layer Perceptron, which is a type of neural network architecture commonly used for
supervised learning tasks like classification and regression. It consists of multiple layers of nodes, each of
which performs a nonlinear transformation of the input data before passing it to the next layer.

Processing term: categorical data analysis technique from hard 10 terms


Categorical data analysis technique refers to any statistical method used to analyze data that has been
categorized or grouped into categories or classes. Hildebrand's del is a specific technique used in
epidemiology to identify risk factors associated with a particular disease or condition. It involves dividing
the population into subsets based on certain characteristics, such as age or gender, and then comparing the
incidence rates of the disease within each subgroup.
