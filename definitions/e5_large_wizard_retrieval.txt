Processing term: Feature Pyramid Network from normal terms


 A Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is a deep learning architecture used in computer vision tasks such as object
detection and image classification. It consists of multiple levels of feature extraction, where each level
takes in a smaller input patch and produces a set of feature maps that capture increasingly detailed
information about the input image. These feature maps are then combined using concatenation or fusion
operations to produce a final output. By stacking multiple levels of feature extraction, FPN can achieve high
accuracy while reducing the number of model parameters compared to traditional single-level architectures.

to highlight important areas of an image and ignore irrelevant ones, which can lead to improved performance on
certain tasks.

Processing term: policy gradient methods from hard 20 terms


Policy gradient methods refer to reinforcement learning algorithms that use the concept of policy gradients to
optimize a policy. Policy gradients are the directional derivative of the expected return with respect to the
policy. They are calculated by taking the partial derivatives of the expected return with respect to each
component of the policy. Policy gradient methods are commonly used in reinforcement learning because they
allow for efficient optimization of policies without requiring knowledge of the exact action-value function.
However, they can suffer from high variance due to the stochastic nature of reinforcement learning
environments. Variance reduction techniques such as actor-critic methods can be used to improve the accuracy
of policy gradients and optimize policies faster.
