Processing term: weight update from hard 20 terms


Weight update refers to the process of adjusting the values of the weights in a neural network in order to
improve its performance on a specific task. This is done by minimizing the difference between the predicted
output and the actual output using backpropagation. The weight update formula is typically expressed as Δw =
L(w,x,ε), where w is the weight vector, x is the input data, ε is the error signal, and L is the learning
algorithm being used. In the case of a multilayer perceptron, the weight update formula would involve
calculating the gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight parameter, and then applying an
optimization algorithm to adjust the weights accordingly.

Processing term: policy gradient methods from hard 20 terms


Policy gradient methods are a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that uses the gradient descent
technique to optimize a policy parameter. The idea behind policy gradient methods is to find the policy that
maximizes the expected reward by iteratively updating the policy parameters using the gradient of the expected
reward with respect to those parameters. Policy gradient methods have been shown to be effective in solving
complex reinforcement learning problems, such as playing Atari games and controlling humanoid robots. However,
they often suffer from high variance in the gradient estimates, which can lead to slow convergence and poor
performance. To address this issue, various techniques have been developed to reduce the variance of policy
gradient estimates, including actor-critic methods that use both value and advantage functions to train a
policy actor.

Processing term: satellite navigation module from hard 20 terms


Satellite navigation module refers to a component of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that uses signals from
satellites in orbit to determine its position and orientation in space. It relies on global navigation
satellite systems (GNSS) such as GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou to calculate its coordinates and adjust its
flight path accordingly.

Processing term: ReLU from hard 20 terms


ReLU stands for Rectified Linear Unit, which is a commonly used activation function in neural networks. It is
defined as f(x) = max(0, x), which means that it returns zero if the input is negative and the input itself if
the input is positive.

Processing term: robust speech or speaker recognition from hard 20 terms


Robust speech or speaker recognition refers to the ability of a machine learning model to accurately recognize
speech or speakers even in the presence of background noise, accents, dialects, and variations in speaking
style. It involves various techniques such as noise reduction, speaker diarization, and automatic speech
recognition. Voice activity detection (VAD) is a crucial component of robust speech or speaker recognition as
it helps to distinguish between speech and non-speech segments, which is essential for accurate speech or
speaker recognition.
