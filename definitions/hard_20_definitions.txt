term: {'role': 'user', 'content': 'weight update'}
 context: {'role': 'system', 'content': 'this is the context of the term: A typical learning algorithm is driven by error signals ε(n ) which are the differences between the actual network output , y(n ) , and the desire ( or target ) output for a given input . For a pattern learning , we can express the weight update in the following general form ∆w(n ) = L(w(n ) , x(n ) , ε(n ) ) where L represents a learning algorithm . If we say that a neural network can describe a model of data , then a multilayer perceptron describes the data in a form of a hypersurface which approximates a functional relationship between x(n ) , and d(n ) .'}


term definition: A weight update refers to the adjustment made to the weights in a neural network during the learning process. It is driven by error signals that quantify the difference between the network's output and the desired output for a given input. The update is determined by a learning algorithm such as backpropagation, and is used to iteratively improve the model's accuracy in approximating the functional relationship between the inputs and outputs.

term definition: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) used in natural language processing (NLP) and other sequential data tasks. It was proposed to address the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs. GRU has gating mechanisms that allow it to selectively update and reset the hidden state, making it more efficient at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.
