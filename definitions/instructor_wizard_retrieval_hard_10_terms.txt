Processing term: end-to-end deep neural network from hard 10 terms


An "end-to-end" deep neural network refers to a type of neural network architecture where all layers are
connected together in a single chain without any intermediate processing stages. This means that there are no
separate pre-processing or feature extraction steps before the actual classification or regression task
begins. End-to-end networks are typically used for tasks such as image recognition, natural language
processing, and speech recognition.

Processing term: Conv ( ) filter from hard 10 terms


A Conv ( ) filter refers to a filter used in a convolutional layer of a neural network. It is a mathematical
operation performed on the input image to extract features from it. The filter has a specific shape and size,
determined by its kernel size, which determines how much of the input image is processed at once. The filter
is applied to the input image multiple times, with different strides and padding, to generate a feature map.
The resulting feature map represents the extracted features from the input image.

Processing term: Time Series Analysis from hard 10 terms


Bootstrapping is a resampling technique used in statistical inference wherein new samples are generated from
original ones by replacing each observation with a randomly chosen observation from the same population. It is
often used to estimate confidence sets and test hypotheses in regression analysis, forecasting, and time
series analysis.
In time series analysis, bootstrapping is used to construct prediction intervals for future observations in
autoregressive time series models. Outlying data points tend to produce high forecast errors, which reduce the
forecasting performances of the existing bootstrap prediction intervals calculated based on non-robust
estimators. Therefore, a robust bootstrap algorithm is proposed in the given context for constructing
prediction intervals and forecast regions using weighted likelihood estimates and weighted residuals.

Processing term: MLP from hard 10 terms


 MLP stands for Multi-Layer Perceptron, which is a type of neural network architecture commonly used for
supervised learning tasks like classification and regression. It consists of multiple hidden layers, each of
which performs a nonlinear transformation of the input data before passing it to the next layer.

Processing term: categorical data analysis technique from hard 10 terms


Categorical data analysis technique refers to the process of analyzing data that falls under the category of
nominal or ordinal variables. It involves techniques such as classification, regression, and association rule
mining to extract meaningful information from such data. Hildebrand's del is one such technique that helps in
detecting associations between categorical variables.
