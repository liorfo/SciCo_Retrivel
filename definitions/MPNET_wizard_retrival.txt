Processing term: Feature Pyramid Network from normal terms


 A Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is a type of neural network architecture used for image classification and
object detection tasks. It consists of multiple levels of feature extraction, where each level represents a
different scale of the input image. At each level, the network applies a set of convolutional filters to
generate feature maps, which are then upsampled using transposed convolutions to match the input image size.
By combining the features from all scales, the FPN can achieve higher accuracy than traditional architectures
that only use a single scale of feature extraction.

Processing term: spatial attention mechanisms from normal terms


Spatial attention mechanisms refer to a technique used in computer vision and natural language processing to

different weights to different parts of an image based on their relevance to the task at hand. In the case of
object tracking, spatial attention mechanisms can be used to identify and prioritize the location of the
target object within the scene. By focusing on the relevant areas of the image, the algorithm can improve its
accuracy and reduce the likelihood of false positives.

Processing term: policy gradient methods from hard 20 terms


Policy gradient methods refer to a family of reinforcement learning algorithms that aim to optimize a policy
by iteratively updating the policy parameters based on the gradient of some performance metric with respect to
the policy. In the context of Q-learning, policy gradient methods can be used to improve the convergence speed
of Q-learning by taking advantage of the fact that the Q-value function is typically smoother than the action-
value function. However, policy gradient methods often suffer from high variance in the gradient estimates,
which can lead to slow convergence or instability. Variance reduction techniques such as actor-critic methods
can be used to address this issue by combining value and advantage functions to train both the policy and the
value function more efficiently.

Processing term: GRU from hard 20 terms


GRU stands for Gated Recurrent Unit. It is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) cell that is commonly used
in the context of natural language processing (NLP). The GRU cell is designed to handle sequential data, such

output. The "gated" aspect of the GRU refers to the fact that there is a gate mechanism that controls the flow
of information into and out of the memory cell. The GRU cell has been found to be particularly effective in
tasks such as machine translation, where the input sequence needs to be predicted based on previously seen
inputs.
