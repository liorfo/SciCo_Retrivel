**good def**

class: no relation, base class: first -> second, new model class: first -> second
first:
In this paper , we review internal and external representations of the UCS , and propose a <m> byte encoding </m> for the UCS .

def:
Byte encoding refers to the process of converting data into bytes or groups of bytes for storage or transmission.
It is often used when working with computer files or digital communication protocols. The proposed "byte encoding"
in the given context likely refers to the method of representing characters or symbols in a computer file using a
fixed number of bytes.

second:
Different from the methods which generate regular expressions from character level , we first utilize <m> byte pair encoder ( BPE ) </m> to extract some frequent items , which are then used to construct regular expressions .

def:
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is a technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to convert text into a
more compact binary representation. It works by breaking down each word in a sentence into two halves,
known as "byte pairs," and encoding them separately. This reduces the amount of memory needed to store
the text and makes it easier to process it using computer algorithms. The resulting encoded text can
then be decoded back into readable form.

**bad def?**

class: no relation, base class: same cluster, new model class: same cluster
first:
We model tag recommendation task as <m> multi-label text classification problem </m> and use Naive Bayes classifier as the base learner of the multilabel classifier .

def:
Multi-label text classification refers to the problem of predicting more than one label for a given piece of text. It involves identifying and categorizing text into multiple categories or
labels instead of just one. The challenge lies in capturing the relationships between different labels and the complexity of the label space.

second:
We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state - of - the - art techniques on <m> multi - label classification </m> and link prediction in several real - world networks from diverse domains .

def:
Multi-label classification is a machine learning technique used to predict multiple possible output classes for a
given input instance instead of just one. It is commonly used in text classification, image recognition, and
recommendation systems. In other words, it involves assigning multiple labels or categories to a single data point rather than just one.

**bad def (with bad results even if the def was good)**

class: no relation, base class: first -> second, new model class: second -> first
first:
They argued unlike physics , areas in <m> AI </m> are more likely to see an impact using more data - driven approaches .

def:
Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer
systems. It involves programming machines to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence,
such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

second:
We do so by applying the maximum likelihood ( <m> ML </m> ) in order to obtain the best performance achievable .

def:
Machine Learning (ML) refers to the process of training algorithms to recognize patterns in data and make
predictions based on those patterns. It involves using statistical techniques to analyze large amounts of
data and identify trends and relationships between variables. The goal of machine learning is to create
models that can accurately predict outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.

**bad def for mlk but still why same cluster?**

class: no relation, base class: same cluster, new model class: same cluster
first:
This work focuses on the problem of multi-label learning with missing labels ( <m> MLML </m> ) , which aims to label
each test instance with multiple class labels given training instances that have an incomplete/partial set of these labels ( i.e. some of their labels are missing ) .

def:
The term "MLML" stands for "Multi-Label Learning with Missing Labels". It refers to a type of machine learning problem
where the goal is to predict multiple labels for each instance, but some of the labels may be missing or
unknown. This can occur when there is insufficient data to train a model for all possible label combinations,
or when the labels themselves are not well defined or subject to change.

second:
We adopted state - of - art graphs kernels for comparison namely : Random Walk ( RW ) , Shortest Path Kernel ( SP ) ,
Graphlet Kernel ( GK ) , Weisfeiler - Lehman Sub - tree Kernel ( WL ) , Deep Graph Kernels ( DGK ) and Multiscale Laplacian Graph Kernels ( <m> MLK </m> ) .

def:
'The term "MLK" is not defined in the given context. It seems to be a misspelling or typo of "Merkle-Leiner'
